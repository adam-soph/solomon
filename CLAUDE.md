# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

solomon is a from-scratch reimplementation of **HolyC** (Terry Davis's TempleOS
language) in Rust. It is a real compiler front end plus a tree-walking
**interpreter** (`src/interp.rs`, the conformance oracle) and two hand-rolled
native code generators behind the **`Codegen`** trait (`src/codegen.rs`), each
named for its target — `arm64` (`aarch64-apple-darwin`, Mach-O via `cc`; and
`aarch64-unknown-linux`, a **freestanding** static ELF) and `x86_64`
(`x86_64-unknown-linux`, a freestanding static ELF; `x86_64-pc-windows`, a PE). A
codegen backend is an (arch, OS) pair, not just a CPU. **Both Linux targets are
freestanding — no libc, no linker, raw syscalls** (there are no gcc-linked
`-gnu`/`-musl` codegen variants; Darwin is the one hosted target, linking
libSystem via `cc`) — and match the interpreter byte-for-byte on all 18
examples.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build                 # debug build (CLIs: target/debug/{hcc,hci}; the lib crate is `solomon`)
cargo build --release       # release build
cargo test                  # whole suite
cargo test --test arm64_darwin     # one integration-test file (each tests/<name>.rs is a crate)
cargo test compiles_floats  # a single test by name (substring match)
cargo fmt                   # format (CI-relevant: keep the tree fmt-clean)
cargo clippy --all-targets  # lint — see note below
```

There are **two binaries** (`src/bin/{hcc,hci}.rs`, auto-discovered by Cargo):
**`hcc`** is the compiler — with **no subcommand it compiles a native binary for
the host** (`-o OUT`, default `a.out`); `--target TRIPLE` cross-compiles;
`check`/`ast`/`tokens` are front-end-only subcommands. **`hci`** is the interpreter
— `hci FILE [args]` runs the program (the conformance oracle). Run a specific
binary with `cargo run --bin`:

```sh
cargo run --bin hcc -- FILE.hc -o out          # compile: native binary for the host
cargo run --bin hcc -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux -o out FILE.hc  # cross-compile (a static ELF)
cargo run --bin hci -- FILE.hc                 # interpret (type-check then run)
cargo run --bin hcc -- check FILE.hc           # parse + sema only, report errors
cargo run --bin hcc -- ast FILE.hc             # dump the parsed AST
cargo run --bin hcc -- tokens FILE.hc          # raw lexer output (no preprocessing)
echo 'I64 Sq(I64 x){return x*x;} "%d\n", Sq(9);' | cargo run --bin hci   # reads stdin if no FILE
```

`make` wraps cargo for cross-compilation (`make`, `make all`, `make <triple>`,
`make dist`, `make macos-universal`); use `CARGO=cross` for non-host OSes. See
the Makefile / README for the target list.

### Important testing notes

- **`tests/arm64_darwin.rs` has two layers** (like `tests/x86_64_linux.rs`). The
  **structural checks** (`produces_a_valid_macho_arm64_object`,
  `main_is_framed_and_returns`) byte-inspect the emitted Mach-O object via
  `Arm64Darwin::object` (which stops *before* the `cc` link step), so they run on
  **every** host with no toolchain. The **end-to-end checks** shell out to `cc`
  and execute real Mach-O binaries (~14s), so they only run on an
  `aarch64-apple-darwin` host with `cc` and self-skip elsewhere (print "skipping"
  and pass). A green `cargo test` off an Apple-silicon Mac therefore exercises the
  AArch64 *emitter* but not *execution* — verify behavioral arm64 changes on an
  Apple-silicon Mac.
- Clippy reports pre-existing stylistic lints across the codebase that are *not*
  enforced; `cargo build` is warning-free and that is the bar. Don't "fix" the
  whole tree — just keep your own additions from adding new warnings.

## Architecture

### The pipeline

Source flows through one direction, each stage a separate module:

```
lexer → preprocessor → parser → sema → layout → backend
```

`parser::parse(src)` is the front-end entry point and is **two-pass**: it first
`hoist_type_names` (streams the preprocessed tokens just to collect `class`/`union`
names) so a type can be used before it is defined, then does the real parse.
`sema::check_program(&Program) -> Vec<SemaError>` runs name resolution + type
inference. `layout::compute(&Program)` computes `repr(C)` sizes/offsets. The CLI
(`src/bin/hcc.rs`) wires these together per mode.

### Streaming tokens (a load-bearing design constraint)

Tokens are **never materialized into a list**. `lexer.rs` defines a
`TokenStream` trait (`next_token()`), implemented by both `Lexer` and
`Preprocessor<S>`. `Parser<S: TokenStream>` is generic over the stream and pulls
tokens lazily through a small look-ahead buffer. The preprocessor is itself a
`TokenStream` that wraps the lexer, so `Parser` sees a `Preprocessor<Lexer>`.
Preserve this: do not add code that collects the full token stream up front.
`#include "file"` keeps this property: the preprocessor maintains a *stack* of
`Lexer`s (one per open file) and pulls from the innermost, so included files
stream in without buffering. The `Lexer` owns its source bytes (so an included
file's lexer can outlive the `&str` it was built from). `#include "file"` paths
resolve relative to the including file's directory; **angle** includes
`#include <name>` (the standard library) resolve first against a *search path* and
then, if not found there, against the **stdlib embedded in the compiler at build
time** (`EMBEDDED_STDLIB` in `lib.rs` — each `lib/*.hc` baked in via `include_str!`,
so the compiler is self-contained and needs no `lib/` on disk; editing a `lib/*.hc`
triggers a recompile). The angle path is reassembled from its lexed tokens by
`angle_path` (unlike the quoted form it isn't a single `Str` token), and both disk
and embedded sources go through the shared `Preprocessor::push_frame`.
`parser::parse(src)` defaults the base dir to the CWD with no search path (so it
uses the embedded stdlib); `parse_in_dir(src, dir)` sets the base dir;
`parse_with(src, dir, search)` sets both (the CLIs pass the input file's parent and
`solomon::stdlib_dirs()` — just the `SOLOMON_STDLIB` override dirs now, searched
before the embedded copy; `hcc -I DIR` prepends more). The library source lives in
`lib/` and is what gets embedded.

### Typed AST

`ast.rs` nodes are `Expr { kind, span, ty }` / `Stmt { kind, span }`. Two things
to know:

- `Expr.ty` is a `RefCell<Option<Type>>`. Sema annotates **every** expression
  with its inferred type via interior mutability (accessors `ty()`/`set_ty()`),
  so all later passes keep immutable `&Program` APIs. Backends read `e.ty()` to
  drive type-directed codegen and `sizeof(expr)`.
- `PartialEq` on AST nodes is hand-written to **ignore spans** (and `ty`), so
  tests can build expected trees with `Span::dummy()`.

`sema`'s `check_ident` returns a variable's **true, undecayed** type; array→pointer
decay is applied at use sites (binary/index/deref). Backends must account for
this (e.g. an array-typed `Ident` means "address of the array data").

### Interpreter & codegen backends

The tree-walking **interpreter** (`src/interp.rs`) is its own top-level module — it
is *not* a code generator. `Interpreter::new(sink).run(&program)` executes a
program (already type-checked) into an output sink; `run_to_string` is the safe
"check then run" entry. It is the conformance oracle.

`codegen.rs` defines `trait Codegen { name() -> triple; run(&Program) }` for the
**native code generators** (each constructed with an output path). Two implement
it — `Arm64Darwin` and `X64Linux` (the public structs; each builds an internal
`Cg` worker that holds the codegen state and emits). The x86-64 one covers
integers/pointers/classes/globals/F64/printf incl. `%f`/`%e`/`%g`/switch/goto + a
libc-free slice of the core-library builtins. **All 18 examples build natively on
both backends**; the only things they don't do are the deliberately-excluded
transcendentals. `CodegenError` (in `codegen.rs`) is the shared run/emit error.

- **`interp.rs`** — tree-walking `Interpreter<W: Write>`. Values are
  `Rc<RefCell<Value>>` cells; pointers use a region+offset model so arithmetic,
  indexing, and comparison work. `MAlloc` of a scalar type and every `union`
  instance are instead **raw byte buffers** (`Region::Heap` / `Value::Union`)
  accessed through `Place::Bytes`, so type punning and overlapping union fields
  match the native byte layout. A pointer (or a class value containing one) stored
  into a byte buffer is **serialised** as an 8-byte handle into the interpreter's
  `PtrTable` — since a `PtrVal` is a region+offset, not an address — and read back
  through it (`serialize_ptr`/`deserialize_ptr`); the handle bytes copy verbatim, so
  a byte-wise `MemCpy` still names the same pointer. And `obj->field` through a
  pointer into a byte heap buffer resolves the field as a `Place::Bytes` at its
  layout offset (via `union_field`), so a class laid out in raw bytes — e.g. a `Pt`
  element of a `Vec`'s data — behaves like the native byte layout. A **whole** class/
  union value stored into or read from a byte heap buffer (a generic `Vec<T>`/`Hmap`
  whose `T` is a class — the `ReAlloc`'d buffer is a byte heap, so the element can't be
  a cell) is (de)serialised field-by-field through the layout
  (`store_bytes_value`/`load_bytes_value`, gated by `ty_is_aggregate` at the
  `Place::Bytes` store/`load_place` boundaries), mirroring the native byte layout — so
  `VecPush(&v, pt)` / `Pt p = VecAt(&v, i)` round-trip a class element. `run_to_string`
  is the safe "check then run" entry. **This interpreter is the conformance oracle
  for the native backends** — when adding native-backend features, match its
  observable output.
- **`backend/arm64_darwin.rs`** — hand-emits AArch64 machine code (no LLVM/Cranelift/C),
  writes a Mach-O relocatable object by hand, and links with the system `cc`.
  Codegen is type-directed (uses `Expr::ty()` + the layout pass). It targets
  `aarch64-apple-darwin` specifically. Several **emission-time optimizations** (no
  separate pass — that would shift instruction positions and break label/fixup
  offsets): constant subexpressions fold to a single `load_imm` (`gen_expr` +
  `const_eval_i64`); **immediate-form arithmetic** (`try_imm_binop`) emits
  `add/sub/cmp #imm` and shift-by-immediate for `<expr> op <small constant>`
  instead of materializing the constant in a register, and **strength-reduces**
  `* / %` by a constant power of two (also in `try_imm_binop`): `* 2^k` → `lsl`,
  and for *unsigned* operands `/ 2^k` → `lsr` and `% 2^k` → `and #2^k-1` (signed
  `/`/`%` need a round-toward-zero bias, so they keep the generic SDIV/MSUB); a
  binary op whose rhs is a
  *simple operand* (`is_simple_operand`: literals, constant folds, scalar
  variables — codegen that provably touches only RES) keeps its lhs in T2 with a
  `mov` instead of a stack push/pop (the F64 analogue `is_simple_foperand` keeps
  the lhs in FT2 with an `fmov`, replacing the `push_f`/`pop_f` GPR+stack
  round-trip); and no-op `mov xd, xd` / zero-sized `sp` adjusts are elided. There
  is also a true **post-emission peephole pass**
  (`Asm::peephole`, run at the start of `finish` before fixups resolve): every
  `Asm` emitter tags its word with register def/use + a branch class
  (`inst_def`/`inst_use`/`inst_branch`, parallel to `words`; the conservative
  `emit` default is "reads everything, is a barrier", and the tagged `e_*`
  helpers refine it), and the pass runs a liveness scan over the scratch
  temporaries x9/x10 to drop dead `mov`s — either *removal* (the copy's target is
  never read again) or *fusion* (the instruction that produced the source is
  rewritten to write the destination directly). Removing a word remaps every
  stored word-index position (`label_pos` + the `.0` of
  fixups/adr_fixups/relocs; label ids and `TableRel`'s base are label indices, so
  they ride along through `label_pos`). All are behavior-preserving — the
  interpreter and the all-examples native conformance test are the oracle. Because
  peephole shifts positions, the Mach-O **defined-symbol offsets are read *after*
  `finish`** (from `CodeImage::label_bytes`, the post-pass `label_pos`) — a pre-`finish`
  `label_byte` would put a late function (the stdlib/monomorphized ones at the end of
  `__text`) past the shrunken section and `ld` would drop the symbol.
  Finally, a per-function **register promotion** pass (`plan_registers`, a light
  register allocator) keeps frequently-used scalar locals/params in callee-saved
  registers instead of frame slots, eliminating per-access load/store traffic (a
  big win in loops). Two independent pools: integer/pointer locals → **x19–x28**,
  F64 locals → the callee-saved double registers **d8–d15**. Candidates are
  non-address-taken scalars declared exactly once and referenced ≥2 times, where
  references are **loop-depth-weighted** (`8^depth`) — so a loop-invariant read
  (a loop bound, say) counts as hot and gets promoted even when its *static* count
  is one, dropping its per-iteration load (`RegAnalysis` scans the body for `&x`,
  weighted reference counts, declaration types, and per-name live intervals; the
  scan's `match`es are exhaustive so a new AST node can't silently hide an
  address-take). Allocation is **linear scan over live
  intervals** (`Cand`): locals whose ranges don't overlap **share** a register, so
  many sequential temporaries collapse onto one register (fewer distinct
  registers ⇒ less save/restore) and a function may promote more than a pool's
  worth of locals. When a pool runs out, the scan **spills** the coldest active
  interval (lowest loop-weighted refs) to a slot if the current candidate is
  hotter, handing it the register — a whole-range swap, not a split. Soundness
  rests on conservative *over*-approximated intervals —
  `[first reference … last reference]` (a declaration counts as the defining
  reference), widened to cover any structured loop they touch (loop-carried values
  stay live across the back-edge), and widened to the whole function when the body
  uses `goto`/labels (then nothing shares); two locals coalesce only when strictly
  disjoint. A promoted
  local has `VarLoc.reg = Some(r)` and no slot — the register's range identifies
  its file (`is_fp_reg`: r < 16 ⇒ a d-register), and the variable's type confirms
  it. Integer reads are `mov RES, r`, writes/inits/`++` `mov r, RES` (narrowed to
  the declared width via `gen_cast`, since there's no store to truncate); F64
  reads/writes are `fmov FRES, r` / `fmov r, FRES` and arithmetic targets the
  d-register directly. Params move from the arg register (`mov`/`fmov`) into `r`.
  The prologue spills each used callee-saved register near x29 with a single
  `stur`/`fstur`; every epilogue restores it with `ldur`/`fldur` (`cs_saves`).
  Promoted locals survive calls (incl. recursion) precisely because x19–x28 /
  d8–d15 are callee-saved.

- **`arm64/linux.rs` — freestanding `aarch64-unknown-linux`** (the only aarch64
  Linux codegen target; there is no gcc-linked libc variant). Shares the entire
  AArch64 emitter and `compile`/`build` drivers with Darwin via the `ArmTarget` seam
  (`freestanding()` + `write_executable()`; Darwin keeps the `write_object()` +
  `link()` path, which now have `unreachable!` trait defaults the freestanding
  target inherits); when set, `Cg.freestanding` flips the
  builtin/printf lowering from libc calls to **emitted AArch64 runtime**, and the
  driver writes a self-contained static ELF (own `_start`, raw syscalls `write`/
  `mmap`/`exit_group`, no linker) — the AArch64 analogue of the `x86_64` freestanding
  backend. Globals self-address via a single `ADR` to a fixed BSS slot (`adr_global_fs`
  + `global_adr_fixups`, no relocations; BSS reserved by `p_memsz > p_filesz`). The
  runtime (lazily emitted once at the end of `__text`, registered via `fs_routine`):
  the redirectable sink `OutWrite` (stdout `write`, or append to a `StrPrint` buffer
  via the `out_ptr` global), the full `FmtInt`/`FmtStr` (all flags/width/precision,
  incl. `*` width/precision from args — `fs_width_prec_flags` pushes the starred
  args before the value and pops them back, a negative `*` width left-justifying —
  mirroring `fmt::render_int`/`render_str`), the correctly-rounded **bignum float
  formatters** `FmtFloat` (`%f`) and `FmtFloatEg` (`%e`/`%g`) over a 48-limb `BIGNUM`
  with `BnMul`/`BnDiv10`/`BnShl`/`BnShr` (round-half-even in `BnShr`; `÷10` via a
  64-iteration shift/subtract since AArch64 has no 128÷64 divide), the bump allocator
  `MAlloc` over `mmap`, the sprintf family (and the lone `StrLen` routine its
  `CatPrint` append calls), and the FP algebraic op `Sqrt` (a single AArch64
  `fsqrt`). The reducible string/memory/ctype/PRNG ops are pure HolyC in
  `lib/*.hc` now, so they compile as ordinary functions rather than emitted
  runtime. `tests/arm64_linux.rs` compiles **all 18 examples** freestanding and
  runs them under `docker --platform linux/arm64` (native on Apple silicon, no qemu),
  asserting byte-for-byte equality with the interpreter; it self-skips with no docker.

- **`backend/x86_64_linux.rs`** — a second native target (Linux/x86-64, *integers
  reached by `--target x86_64-unknown-linux` (CLI) or `X64Linux::new(path)`. It hand-emits
  x86-64 machine code and writes a **self-contained static ELF executable** — its
  own `_start` runs the program and calls the `exit` syscall, so there is no
  linker, no libc, and no relocations (`[ELF header | one PT_LOAD | code |
  strings | BSS]`, mapped R+W+X at `0x400000`; jumps/calls use rel32 fixups, and
  string/global references RIP-relative disp32s, all resolved in `Asm::finish`).
  Implemented: top-level code and **functions** (recursion, ≤6 integer/pointer
  args via the System V registers `rdi…r9`), **locals** (a `push rbp` frame,
  `[rbp-off]`), **control flow** (`if`/`else`/`while`/`for`/`do`/`break`/`continue`,
  `switch` — single/`lo ... hi`-range `case`s, `default`, and the `start:`/`end:`
  sub-labels, lowered to a compare-chain like arm64; `goto`/labels, pre-collected
  per function so forward jumps resolve),
  **comparisons** + short-circuit `&&`/`||`/`!`, unary `- + ~ ++ --`, the
  binary `+ - * / % & | ^ << >>` (`>>`/`/`/`%` and the relational ops are
  **signedness-directed** — `sar`/`idiv` vs `shr`/`div`, signed vs unsigned
  condition codes, keyed off the operand types as in the other backends), and
  **pointers & arrays** — `&x`, `*p`, `a[i]`
  (incl. 2-D), pointer arithmetic (pointee-scaled) and difference, width-aware
  narrow loads/stores (`movsx`/`movzx`), and array parameters that decay to a
  by-reference pointer (the `indirect` `VarLoc`), **classes & unions** (`repr(C)`
  offsets/sizes from the shared layout pass: `a.x` and `p->x` member access via
  `gen_addr`, nested fields, `sizeof`, whole-class assignment, **by-value**
  parameters lowered to a `rep movsb` copy — `class` rvalues are carried by
  address, the callee copies its arg into a local slot (in two passes so a class
  copy can't clobber later args still in arg registers) — and **by-value returns**
  (**sret**: the caller allocates a result temp and hands its address to the
  callee in `r11`; the callee saves that pointer and `rep movsb`s the result
  through it on `return`; member access on a class-returning call like `Mk().x`
  works since the rvalue is its address); arrays of classes and
  heap-free linked lists; union aliasing, with anonymous-embedded unions resolved
  through their promoted field offset), **globals** (top-level variables are
  allocated in a zero-filled BSS region that follows the strings in the address
  space — `p_memsz > p_filesz` reserves it, never in the file — addressed by
  RIP-relative disp32 like strings (`Asm::lea_global` + `global_fixups`), so
  functions read/write them and `Codegen::declare_global` lays them out
  `repr(C)`; only their initialisers run, in program order, in `_start`),
  **F64** (SSE2: `xmm0`/`xmm1` as the float result/temp, F64 args in `xmm0..xmm7`
  and returns in `xmm0` — counted independently of the GP arg registers;
  `gen_fexpr`/`gen_foperand` mirror the arm64 backend, with arithmetic, `-`,
  comparisons via `ucomisd`+unsigned `setcc`, and signedness-directed int↔float
  conversions (`cvtsi2sd`, `cvttsd2si`, and a 2^63-split `gen_f64_to_u64` for
  unsigned targets); float literals materialise as `mov`+`movq` with no constant
  pool), plus
  **printing** — a bare string prints verbatim, `"fmt", …`/`Print("fmt", …)` are
  printf-style with the **full** `%[flags][width][.prec]conv` grammar (flags
  `- 0 + space #`, `*` width/precision from args) for `%d %i %u %x %X %o %c %s
  %f %e %g %%` — the float forms are **correctly-rounded** via a 48-limb `BIGNUM`,
  matching Rust's `{:.P}`/`{:.Pe}` byte-for-byte (incl. round-half-to-even ties).
  `%f` (`emit_fmt_float` + `emit_bn_*`) builds J = round(m·2^e·10^P) by ×5^P then a
  binary shift with round-half-even, extracts decimal digits, and places the
  point. `%e`/`%g` (`emit_fmt_float_eg`) work from the value's **exact** finite
  decimal expansion (a double `m·2^e` is the dyadic rational `Dint·10^pe`, so
  `Dint = m·5^(−e)` is integer) — extract all digits, round the digit string to N
  significant figures (half-even, with carry-overflow bumping the exponent), then
  format `d.dddde±XX` (`%e`) or choose fixed/scientific and trim trailing zeros
  (`%g`). It's a stack machine in `rax` (left operand spilled
  to the machine stack while the right is computed, so values survive nested
  calls); an lvalue's address comes from `gen_addr`, with width-aware load/store
  through it. Type sizes/strides come from the [layout pass](crate::layout).
  Printing needs no libc: a tiny emitted runtime — `fmt_int`/`fmt_str` (emitted
  once, on demand), hand-assembled to **mirror `fmt::render_int`/`render_str`
  byte-for-byte** off the shared `fmt::parse` spec, building the padded field in a
  BSS scratch buffer and handing it to a single output sink (`out_write`): to the
  `write` syscall when the `out_ptr` global is 0, else appended to a destination
  buffer (advancing `out_ptr`) — so the **same** format machinery drives both
  `Print` and the sprintf family. The format routines
  are written with a small generic register-encoder layer added to `Asm`
  (`mov_rr`/`mov_ri`/`alu_rr`/byte loads-stores, etc.). String literals live
  *after* the code, RIP-relative addressed; `Asm::finish` resolves rel32 branch
  fixups, the string references and the global references, then appends the string
  bytes (the BSS follows in vaddr space). The **irreducible core-library builtins**
  are lowered inline or to emitted runtime routines (`gen_builtin` +
  `emit_rt_routines`): `MAlloc`/`Free` (a bump allocator over `mmap`'d 1 MiB
  chunks; `Free` is a no-op), and the **sprintf family**
  `StrPrint`/`CatPrint` (printf into a buffer via the output sink;
  `CatPrint` appends at `dst + StrLen(dst)`, so `StrLen` is the one string runtime
  routine still emitted). The reducible string/memory/ctype/PRNG ops are pure HolyC
  in `lib/*.hc` now and compile as ordinary functions — the per-op `emit_rt_*`
  routines, the `emit_rt_ctype` range-checker and the `RandU64` splitmix were
  removed with the migration. The transcendentals aren't builtins at all (see the
  `builtins.rs` note — they're excluded project-wide), so nothing math-related is
  missing; `Sqrt`/`Fabs` are pure HolyC in `lib/math.hc` (a Newton sqrt and a union
  sign-clear), so this backend lowers no algebraic float builtin.
  `MStrPrint` (a **growing sink** like libc's `vasprintf`: `MAlloc` a small owned
  buffer, then format in one pass while the sink reallocs-and-copies on overflow —
  `Helper::GrowSink`, doubling capacity — so the result is just `out_base` when
  done; no measure pass, no fixed cap) is implemented too, so the whole
  core-library builtin set is covered. `F64ToStr` is **not** a builtin — it's the
  one-line HolyC wrapper `StrPrint(buf, "%g", v)` in `lib/cstr.hc`, so it reuses
  this same formatter rather than carrying its own. The print-runtime helpers are
  emitted by a deterministic fixpoint (`emit_helpers`) so a float formatter pulled
  in only by a compiled-but-not-top-level function — like that `F64ToStr` wrapper —
  still gets its transitive `OutWrite`/bignum sub-routines placed. (**All 18 examples compile and run
  natively**, matching the interpreter.) Tests in
  `tests/x86_64_linux.rs` verify the ELF structure
  on any host and **execute** the produced binary — directly on a `linux`/`x86_64`
  host, otherwise via one `docker run --platform linux/amd64` container (the
  static ELF needs no libc) — checking exit codes *and* stdout byte-for-byte
  against the interpreter (incl. whole example programs), self-skipping when
  neither runner is available.

### builtins vs. intrinsics

Two mechanisms give a function compiler-provided behaviour. **`builtins.rs`** is the
registry of true builtins — names sema seeds with a signature *without* a source
definition (no `#include` needed). **`intrinsics.rs`** ([`crate::intrinsics`]) is the
newer, preferred seam: a recognized **standard-library** function — declared in
`lib/*.hc` (so it's resolved like any library call, *with* an include) — that the
backends lower specially. The arc is to keep the builtin *registry* down to the few
things that can't be library functions at all and push everything else through
intrinsics. Two intrinsic flavours (`IntrinsicKind`): an **Optimization** has a real
HolyC body the backend may replace with an instruction where the target supports it,
else it calls the body (`Sqrt` → `fsqrt`/`sqrtsd`, else the lib Newton; the
interpreter always runs the body, and both are correctly rounded, so they agree); a
**Primitive** is a lib *prototype* (no body) the backend *must* lower because it
bundles OS syscalls or the format machinery — currently the printf family
`Print`/`StrPrint`/`CatPrint`/`MStrPrint` (declared in `lib/fmt.hc`). The dispatch in
both backends and the interpreter gates the bespoke lowering on
`builtins::is_builtin(name) || intrinsics::is_primitive(name)`; a `Primitive`'s
body-less prototype is naturally skipped by the per-function emission loop, and the
call site is intercepted before any label lookup. (Bare strings and the `"fmt", args`
comma form are lowered inline — *not* calls to `Print` — so they need no include.)

`builtins.rs` (`all()`, `is_builtin()`, `libc_symbol()`) **seeds sema signatures, the
interpreter dispatches behaviour, and the arm64 backend lowers via `libc_symbol()`.**
The registry is now **just `ArgC`/`ArgV` and the `VarArg*` accessors** — the
primitives that can't be library functions at all (they read hidden globals / need
ABI support, with no `#include`). Everything else became a lib function or
`Primitive` intrinsic: the printf family → `lib/fmt.hc`; the heap — the universal
`MAlloc`/`Free` pair → the implicit prelude `lib/builtin.hc` (ambient, no `#include`),
the advanced `HeapExtend`/`MSize` → `lib/mem.hc`; the clock
`UnixNS`/`NanoNS`/`Sleep` → `lib/time.hc`; the fd I/O primitives
`Open`/`LSeek`/`Read`/`Write`/`Close` → `lib/io.hc` (files), the socket pair
`Socket`/`Connect` → `lib/net.hc`; the process/OS group `Exit`/`Getpid` and the
filesystem mutations `Remove`/`Rename`/`Mkdir` → `lib/os.hc`; the
thread primitives `Thread`/`Join` → `lib/thread.hc`; the atomics
`AtomicLoad`/`AtomicStore`/`AtomicAdd`/`AtomicSwap`/`AtomicCas` → `lib/sync.hc`;
`Sqrt`/`Fabs` + rounding/transcendentals → `lib/math.hc`; `StrToF64`/`F64ToStr` →
`lib/strconv.hc`/`lib/cstr.hc`; and the string/memory/ctype ops → their modules. A
**compiled user function shadows a like-named primitive** (a program's own
`Join`/`Read`): the interpreter and both backends call the body when one is in scope,
falling back to the bespoke lowering only for the bodyless lib prototype. (`libc_symbol` stays only as a name→symbol map for the hosted
Darwin lowering of `MAlloc`/`Free`, independent of `all()`.) Calling a migrated
function by name now needs its `#include` — but bare strings and the `"fmt", args`
comma form are inline, not `Print` calls. For reference, the historical full builtin
set was: the printf family `Print` (→
`printf`), `StrPrint` (→ `sprintf`, returns dst), `CatPrint` (sprintf-append, into
`dst+strlen(dst)`) and `MStrPrint` (asprintf-style) — they could read `...` in HolyC
now (the `VarArg*` accessors exist), but stay builtins because they bundle the
format-rendering machinery (the shared `fmt` spec + correctly-rounded bignum floats
the backends emit), not practical as byte-identical HolyC. **Float conversion is no
longer here at all**: `StrToF64` (`atof`) is a correctly-rounded bignum parser in
`lib/strconv.hc` (over the `Bn` big integer in `lib/bignum.hc`) — pure HolyC, so it
works on the freestanding targets too (no host libc), and its inverse `F64ToStr` is
a `StrPrint(buf, "%g", v)` wrapper in `lib/cstr.hc`. Heap `MAlloc`/`Free` (a
syscall/libc primitive),
`HeapExtend(ptr, old, new)` (the one irreducible bit of `realloc` — grow a bump
allocator's last block in place, else NULL; the move+copy `ReAlloc` is HolyC in
`lib/mem.hc`) and `MSize(ptr)` (the requested size of a block — when a program
uses it, `MAlloc` prepends an 8-byte size header, **gated** so size-agnostic
programs keep the lean header-free heap byte-for-byte; the interpreter keeps a side
table, Darwin wraps libc `malloc`/`free` with the header); **no algebraic float
ops** — `Sqrt` (a correctly-rounded Newton + Dekker-residual implementation) and
`Fabs` (a `union` sign-bit clear) are both pure HolyC in `lib/math.hc` now, so a
program with no special needs links no math builtin at all; the
captured command line `ArgC`/`ArgV` and the environment `EnvP` (a NULL-terminated
`U8 **` of "KEY=VALUE" strings — captured at the entry like the command line: from
`main`'s 3rd arg on Darwin/x2, off the initial stack past argv freestanding, NULL on
Windows; the interpreter builds it from the real `std::env`); the variadic-argument
accessors
`VarArgCnt`/`VarArgI64`/`VarArgF64`/`VarArg` (need ABI support); and the impure
clock primitives `UnixNS`/`NanoNS`/`Sleep` (below). `NULL`/`TRUE`/`FALSE` are const
builtins. **Everything reducible now lives in `lib/*.hc`** as pure HolyC built on
the deterministic F64/integer ops + these primitives, so each function's *defined
algorithm* computes identically on the interpreter and every backend; pull it in
with an angle include (`#include <cstr.hc>` / `#include <vec.hc>` / `#include <math.hc>`). Each lib
file is wrapped in an `#ifndef _NAME_HC` include guard, so a module can include
another (or a program can include the same one twice) without a redefinition error.

The string/memory library is split along the C-header lines so each module is
includable on its own:

- `lib/cstr.hc` — C-style `U8 *` NUL-terminated string primitives (the `<string.h>`
  `str*` family): `StrLen`/`StrCmp`/`StrNCmp`/`StrCpy`/`StrNCpy`/`StrCat`/`StrFind`/
  `StrChr`/`StrLastChr`/`StrSpn`/`StrCSpn`/`StrToUpper`/`StrToLower`/`StrRev`, and
  number conversion (`StrToI64`/`I64ToStr`, and `F64ToStr` = `StrPrint("%g")`). (The
  `Abs`/`Sign` integer helpers moved to `<math.hc>`, next to the float ops.)
- `lib/mem.hc` — raw memory + the **advanced heap intrinsics** (`HeapExtend`/`MSize`
  prototypes — the compiler is their implementation; the universal `MAlloc`/`Free` pair
  is in the prelude `lib/builtin.hc` instead, ambient with no `#include`), the `mem*`
  family (`MemCpy`/`MemMove`/`MemSet`/`MemCmp`/`MemFind`/`MemSearch`), `CAlloc` (zeroed
  allocation — `MAlloc` + `MemSet`, since the hosted libc heap isn't zeroed), and
  `ReAlloc` over `HeapExtend`.
- `lib/fmt.hc` — the **printf-family intrinsics**: `Print`/`StrPrint`/`CatPrint`/
  `MStrPrint` prototypes (the backends render them; bare strings and the `"fmt", args`
  comma form need no include).
- `lib/time.hc` — the impure **clock intrinsics** `UnixNS`/`NanoNS`/`Sleep` prototypes
  (the one non-reproducible group — conformance by property, not value), plus calendar
  math over them (`DateTime`, `FromUnix`/`ToUnix`/`FmtISO`/`IsLeap`/`Now`).
- `lib/bignum.hc` — `class Bn`, a minimal arbitrary-precision **nonnegative** integer
  (little-endian base-2^32 limbs, fixed `d[72]`): build-from-digits, scale by powers
  of two, compare, subtract. No division/general multiply — only what decimal→binary
  conversion needs.
- `lib/strconv.hc` — `StrToF64`, a **correctly-rounded** `atof` over `<bignum.hc>`: a
  Clinger fast path (one exact F64 op for ≤15-digit significands with `|k|≤22`) and an
  exact bignum slow path (build the value as an integer ratio, normalise into
  `[2^52,2^53)` with powers of two, extract the 53-bit mantissa by shift/compare/
  subtract — no bignum divide — and round half-to-even). Pure HolyC, so it runs on the
  freestanding targets (no libc `atof`) and is bit-identical to a reference `strtod`.
- `lib/ctype.hc` — ASCII character classification (`<ctype.h>`): `ToUpper`/`ToLower`
  and the `Is*` predicates (`IsDigit`/`IsAlpha`/`IsSpace`/…, returning 0/1 —
  deliberately not libc's `isdigit`, whose unspecified nonzero would diverge).
- `lib/vec.hc` — `class Vec<T>`, an owning, growable typed array (a generic dynamic
  array on `<mem.hc>`'s `ReAlloc`), **monomorphized per element type** at compile time.
  Typed throughout — no casts, no element-size bookkeeping; the type args are inferred
  from the call: `Vec<I64> v; VecInit(&v); VecPush(&v, 42); I64 x = VecAt(&v, 0);`.
  Works for scalar, pointer, and **class** element types — the class case stores/loads a
  *whole element value* (`VecPush(&v, pt)` / `Pt p = VecAt(&v, i)`), which the
  interpreter (de)serialises field-by-field through the heap byte buffer
  (`store_bytes_value`/`load_bytes_value` in `interp.rs`, mirroring the native byte
  layout — the buffer is a `ReAlloc`'d byte heap, so a class element can't be a cell);
  `VecRef(&v, i)` returns a `T *` for in-place update. It `#include`s `<sort.hc>` and
  owns `VecSort(&v, cmp)` / `VecBSearch(&v, key, cmp)` (the latter returns an index, or
  -1). `VecInit`/`VecFree`/`VecClear`/`VecLen`/`VecReserve`/`VecPush`/`VecPop`/`VecAt`/
  `VecRef`/`VecSet`/`VecClone`/`VecSort`/`VecBSearch`.
- `lib/hmap.hc` — `class Hmap<K, V>`, an owning **generic** hash map (separate chaining
  over a growing bucket array on `<mem.hc>`), monomorphized per (key, value) type. Keys
  and values are typed — no casts. The key's hashing/equality are function pointers given
  at `HmapInit(&m, hash, eq)` (each taking a `K *`). Entries are a typed
  `class HmapEntry<K, V> { HmapEntry<K, V> *next; K key; V val; }` (a generic class that
  **nests its own generic type** — see the generics note below); `HmapGet` returns
  `(V value, Bool found)` (the flag a sentinel can't express). Two stock key kinds ship:
  `HmapI64{Hash,Eq}` (I64 keys) and `HmapStr{Hash,Eq}` (`U8 *` keys — stores the
  **pointer**, `StrCmp`/djb2 via the private `<_impl/strhash.hc>` `Djb2`, so a string key
  must outlive the map). It `#include`s `<vec.hc>` for iteration: `HmapKeys`/`HmapValues`
  collect into a `Vec<K>`/`Vec<V>`, `HmapEntries` into a `Vec<HmapKV<K, V>>` (a
  `{K key; V val;}` pair, key at offset 0 so a stock comparator sorts by key), and
  `HmapSortKeys(m, &out, cmp)` returns the keys sorted (e.g. `&CmpStr`/`&CmpI64`).
  `HmapInit`/`HmapFree`/`HmapPut`/`HmapGet`/`HmapHas`/`HmapDel`/`HmapLen`/`HmapKeys`/
  `HmapValues`/`HmapEntries`/`HmapSortKeys`.
- `lib/sort.hc` — generic sorting + binary search (the `qsort`/`bsearch` pair),
  **standalone** (no other library dependency). Element size is a parameter and order is
  a caller comparator `I64 (*cmp)(U8 *a, U8 *b)` (<0/0/>0, like `StrCmp`) — it receives
  *pointers to two elements*; stock ones ship: `CmpI64`/`CmpU64`/`CmpF64` here, and
  `CmpStr` (a `U8 *` string-pointer element, so it dereferences a `U8 **`) in `<cstr.hc>`
  next to `StrCmp`. `Sort(base, n, esize, cmp)` is a median-of-three quicksort with an
  insertion-sort
  cutoff (not stable); element moves are a **byte-wise `SortSwap`** (a scalar byte temp,
  no buffer — so it works through the interpreter's heap byte buffers and moves
  serialised pointer/class bytes verbatim). `BSearch(key, base, n, esize, cmp)` returns a
  matching element pointer or NULL. The container conveniences live in the containers
  that `#include` this — `<vec.hc>`'s `VecSort`/`VecBSearch` and `<hmap.hc>`'s
  `HmapSortKeys` — one quicksort serving every element type (see `examples/sort.hc`: I64
  and string vectors).

The math library is layered into four modules (each includes the one below):

- `lib/bits.hc` — the lowest layer: the `_F64Bits` union and the IEEE bit/
  classification ops (`Float64bits`/`Float64frombits`/`NaN`/`Inf`/`IsNaN`/`IsInf`/
  `Signbit`/`Copysign`), pure bit manipulation with no other dependency.
- `lib/math.hc` — elementary functions (includes `<bits.hc>`): `Fabs` (a `union`
  sign-bit clear), **`Sqrt`** (a correctly-rounded software square root: reduce
  `x = f·2^(2k)`, Newton-iterate `√f`, then a Dekker exact-residual correction —
  bit-identical to hardware `fsqrt` over a 500k battery), the rounding family
  (`Floor`/`Ceil`/`Round`/`RoundToEven`/`Trunc`/`Mod`/`Fmod`), exponent ops
  (`Frexp`/`Ldexp`/`Logb`/`Ilogb`), the transcendentals (`Sin`/`Cos`/`Pow`/`Exp`/
  `Ln`/…, each with a *defined* series, reproducible — unlike a libm call), and the
  rest of the Go-`math` elementary surface (`Cbrt`/`Expm1`/`Log1p`/`Asinh`/…/
  `Modf`/`Dim`/`Remainder`/`Nextafter`/`FMA`/`Sincos`). `Fabs`/`Sqrt` and the
  rounding ops are also **optimization intrinsics** — a backend emits the FP
  instruction in place, falling back to the HolyC body — so **no float op is a
  builtin**.
- `lib/special.hc` — the bulky special functions (includes `<math.hc>`): the error
  function / gamma families (`Erf`/`Erfc`/`Erfinv`/`Erfcinv`/`Gamma`/`Lgamma`) and
  Bessel (`J0`/`J1`/`Jn`/`Y0`/`Y1`/`Yn` — series for small x, asymptotic beyond,
  Miller recurrence). Split out because they're rarely used.
- `lib/rand.hc` — the deterministic `RandU64` splitmix64 over a `_rand_state`
  global (fixed zero seed), plus `SeedRand(seed)` to start a different deterministic
  stream. Standalone (no math dependency).
- `lib/io.hc` — file-descriptor I/O. The raw `Open`/`LSeek`/`Read`/`Write`/`Close`
  `Primitive` intrinsics (the `Read`/`Write`/`Close` trio is **shared with sockets**)
  lower to libc on Darwin and raw **syscalls** freestanding, routed through the same
  `emit_call`/`gen_int_args` arg path + a `CallTarget::Syscall`/`mov rax,nr; syscall`
  tail as the sockets. The fd ops map their args straight to the syscall registers;
  `Open` needs per-target massaging (`gen_open`): freestanding uses `openat` with an
  AT_FDCWD (`-100`) prepend (aarch64 syscall 56 has no bare `open`; x86-64 uses `open`
  2), and Darwin's libc `open` is **variadic** so the `mode` arg goes on the stack
  (Apple ABI) after a Linux→macOS **open-flag translation** (`O_CREAT`/`O_TRUNC`/
  `O_APPEND` differ). The `io.hc` flag `#define`s are the canonical **Linux** values
  (Darwin + the interpreter translate); the mode is `MODE_0644 = 0644` (octal). On top
  it builds `WriteAll`/`ReadFile`/`WriteFile`/
  `AppendFile`/`FileSize`. Impure, so property-tested (`tests/io.rs`: write→read a
  temp file, same stdout on the interpreter, arm64 Darwin, and both freestanding ELFs).
  The interpreter emulates fds over `std::fs`/`std::net` in a unified `fds` table
  (`FdObj::{PendingSocket,Tcp,File}`). (Filesystem *mutation* — `Remove`/`Rename`/`Mkdir`
  — lives in `<os.hc>`.)
- `lib/net.hc` — TCP networking; `#include <io.hc>` for the shared
  `Read`/`Write`/`Close`/`WriteAll`. The socket-specific `Socket`/`Connect`
  `Primitive` intrinsics lower to libc on Darwin and raw socket **syscalls**
  freestanding (arm64 Linux 198/203, x86-64 Linux 41/42; Darwin int returns are
  `sxtw`-sign-extended). On top it builds `ParseIPv4`, `MakeSockaddr` (a 16-byte
  `sockaddr_in` in a `U8[16]`), `TcpConnect`, and a minimal `HttpGet`. Property-tested
  (`tests/net.rs`: an echo round-trip on the interpreter, arm64 Darwin, and both
  freestanding ELFs under `docker` with an in-container `socat` echo).
- `lib/os.hc` — process and OS helpers. Process control: `Exit(code)` (freestanding
  `exit_group` 94/231, Darwin libc `exit`, Windows `ExitProcess` via the OsTarget
  `emit_exit` seam; the interpreter halts the run via an `exit_code` field) and the id
  reads `Getpid`/`Getppid`/`Getuid`/`Getgid` (no-arg syscalls 172/173/174/176 arm64,
  39/110/102/104 x86-64, Darwin libc `_getpid`/`_getppid`/`_getuid`/`_getgid`; the
  interpreter uses `std::process::id`/`parent_id` and libc `getuid`/`getgid` FFI; impure
  → property-tested).
  Filesystem mutation `Remove`/`Rename`/`Mkdir` and `Chdir` (`gen_fsop`, all 0/-errno):
  freestanding aarch64 `*at` syscalls (`unlinkat`/`renameat`/`mkdirat` + AT_FDCWD, no
  bare form; `chdir` 49 is bare) or x86-64 bare `unlink` 87/`rename` 82/`mkdir` 83/`chdir`
  80, Darwin libc with the `-1`→`-errno` conversion (`darwin_errno_neg`, shared with
  `Open`); interp over `std::fs`/`std::env`. `Getcwd(buf, size)` (`gen_getcwd`) is the
  one with a return to normalise — the `getcwd` syscall (arm64 17/x86-64 79) returns a
  length, Darwin libc returns the buffer pointer, both mapped to 0-on-success/`-errno`.
  And the environment accessors `Getenv(name)`/`Environ(&out)` are
  **pure HolyC** over the implicit `EnvP` array (the irreducible bit is the entry-time
  env capture; the search/collection is reducible, so library functions not builtins) —
  `Getenv` returns a pointer to the value after `name=` or NULL; `Environ` collects every
  "KEY=VALUE" entry into a `<vec.hc>` Vec (so `os.hc` `#include`s `<vec.hc>`). Both guard
  `EnvP == NULL` (the Windows case). All property-tested in `tests/io.rs` (interp + arm64
  Darwin local, freestanding on CI), with looked-up env values scoped to the child via
  `Command::env`.
- `lib/thread.hc` — POSIX-style threads: `Thread(fn, arg)` / `Join(handle)`
  (`Primitive` intrinsics). Darwin lowers to libc `pthread_create`/`pthread_join` (the
  HolyC `I64 Fn(I64)` matches the `void *(*)(void *)` start-routine ABI exactly, so the
  function pointer passes straight through). Freestanding spawns a real `CLONE_THREAD`
  thread via raw `clone(2)` onto an `mmap`'d stack: a 32-byte TCB at the base —
  `[retval | ctid futex | fn | arg]` — carries the closure in and the result out, and
  `Join` is a **futex** wait on the `ctid` word (`CLONE_PARENT_SETTID` sets it
  synchronously so the join can't race; `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID` zeroes it + wakes on
  exit). The TCB base is captured into the **child via a callee-saved register**
  (x19 / rbx — inherited at clone), *not* a frame slot, since the parent overwrites the
  slot on the next spawn. The x86-64 freestanding path uses glibc's exact flag set
  (incl. `CLONE_SYSVSEM`) and a valid TLS self-pointer, which the emulated x86-64 docker
  runtime (Rosetta/qemu) requires for thread clones. Impure/concurrent, so the
  interpreter runs each body **synchronously at spawn time** (`thread_results`) and is
  conformant for interleaving-independent work (per-thread results, no shared-state
  race) — `tests/thread.rs` spawns workers, joins, and sums, the same stdout on the
  interpreter, arm64 Darwin, and both freestanding ELFs.
- `lib/sync.hc` — atomics + a mutex for sharing mutable state between threads. The
  five atomic ops `AtomicLoad`/`AtomicStore`/`AtomicAdd`/`AtomicSwap`/`AtomicCas`
  (`Primitive` intrinsics) lower to the hardware atomics, **width-directed by the
  pointer's pointee type** (1/2/4/8 bytes — a `U32` counter, a pointer, `U8`, …; the
  result is sign/zero-extended per the pointee like a normal load, masked the same way
  in the interpreter via `cast_value`). AArch64 `ldar`/`stlr` for load/store and
  sized `ldaxr`/`stlxr` retry loops for add/swap/cas (acquire/release); x86-64 plain
  aligned `mov` for load/store and the sized `lock`-prefixed `xadd`/`xchg`/`cmpxchg`.
  (Because `check_call` validates only argument *count*, the prototypes stay `I64 *p`
  and the pointee width comes from the call-site type — in the interpreter via
  `eval_atomic`, dispatched from `eval_call`.) `AtomicFence` is a full barrier
  (`dmb ish` / `mfence`). `Mutex` (Init/Lock/TryLock/Unlock) is a **blocking** 3-state
  futex lock (Drepper) in pure HolyC over `AtomicCas`/`AtomicSwap` + the low-level
  `FutexWait`/`FutexWake` intrinsics — the Linux `futex(2)` syscall freestanding
  (`FUTEX_WAIT`/`FUTEX_WAKE` on the low 32 bits) and libc `__ulock_wait`/`__ulock_wake`
  on Darwin; each `FutexWait` carries a ~1 ms safety-net timeout (a relative `timespec`
  freestanding, µs on Darwin) so a lost wakeup re-checks instead of deadlocking. The
  On the same primitives, in pure HolyC: a **condition variable** `Cond` (Init/Wait/
  Signal/Broadcast — a seq-counter futex; `CondWait` snapshots the seq, drops the
  mutex, futex-waits, re-locks) and a readers-preferred **`RwLock`** (Init/RLock/
  RUnlock/WLock/WUnlock — one signed state word: `N>0` readers, `-1` a writer). The
  interpreter, with synchronous threads, does a plain read-modify-write (no contention),
  treats the fence/futex ops as no-ops, and always acquires on the first try.
  **Freestanding globals are 16-byte-aligned** for these (the BSS base is rounded up +
  the image padded, gated on the program having globals): the AArch64 acquire/exclusive
  ops *fault* on misalignment (SIGBUS) and a misaligned x86 `lock` op is a split-lock
  (`#AC`). `tests/sync.rs`: threads hammer a shared atomic counter + the uncontended
  mutex fast path on all four targets; the *contended* blocking mutex, the producer/
  consumer `Cond`, and the `RwLock` run on the native arm64 runners (the `RwLock` —
  interleaving-independent — on the interpreter too); the x86 docker emulation
  deadlocks blocking sync, and the synchronous interpreter can't model a condvar
  consumer waiting on a later producer.

(The transcendentals are deliberately *not* builtins: an intrinsic must have a
portable, solomon-defined value, but a transcendental's would be only "whatever the
host libm computes," not reproducible across platforms and impossible in a
freestanding target — so they belong in the library with a defined algorithm.)
`Print`/`StrPrint`/`CatPrint`/`MStrPrint` are *not* in `libc_symbol`: all are
special-cased in the arm64 backend
(`gen_print`/`gen_formatted_write`/`gen_mstrprint`) to translate the format
string (`translate_format`) and pass variadic args on the stack (Apple ABI); the
interpreter renders them with the shared `fmt` module. The remaining libc-backed
builtins (`MAlloc`/`Free`) keep their HolyC signature 1:1
with the libc one, so they lower through the generic path with no special-casing.
(The string/memory/ctype/PRNG lowering machinery the backends used to carry —
`gen_str_case`, the `ctype_ranges` emitter, the `RNG_STATE_GLOBAL` splitmix, the
per-op `emit_rt_*`/`emit_fs_*` routines — has been **removed**: those ops are
ordinary `lib/*.hc` functions now. Each backend keeps only the runtime routines its
own machinery still needs — e.g. `StrLen`, which `CatPrint`'s append calls
internally.) The **clock/time primitives** `UnixNS` (wall-clock ns,
CLOCK_REALTIME), `NanoNS` (monotonic ns, CLOCK_MONOTONIC) and `Sleep(ns)` are the
one **impure, non-reproducible** group: the clock differs between an interpreter
run and a native run, so the byte-for-byte conformance is *relaxed* for them —
they're tested by **property** (monotonic non-decreasing across a `Sleep`; wall
clock past 1970), never by interp-vs-native value comparison. The interpreter uses
`std::time`; the freestanding backends emit `clock_gettime`/`nanosleep` syscalls
(arm64 113/101, x86_64 228/35) over a 16-byte BSS timespec, folding `sec·1e9+nsec`;
Darwin calls libc `clock_gettime`/`nanosleep` over a stack timespec (macOS
`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`=6, not Linux's 1); Windows lowers them via kernel32
(`GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime` → ns since 1970, `GetTickCount64`×1e6, `Sleep`)
through the `OsTarget::emit_unix_ns`/`emit_mono_ns`/`emit_sleep` seam. The arm64 backend reaches libc
through a generic
external-symbol mechanism (`SymRef::Extern("_sym")` + `Asm::bl_extern`); the
Mach-O writer emits one undefined symbol per referenced libc function, so adding
a libc-backed builtin needs no new relocation plumbing. Two conformance notes:
`StrCmp` is normalized to a sign in `{-1,0,1}` in *both* backends (libc's
magnitude is unspecified — the native side reduces it with `sxtw`+`cset`); and
`MAlloc` in the interpreter is **byte-addressable** for integer/float element
types: it returns a `Region::Heap(Vec<u8>)` raw buffer, and a typed access
serializes `sizeof(T)` bytes (`Place::Bytes`), so aliasing the same buffer
through different scalar pointer types — **type punning** (`U8 *b = p` over an
`I64*`) — behaves like the native heap. Heap pointer arithmetic scales by the
element size (`ptr_step`/`heap_ptr_arith`). Class/pointer-element allocations
still use cell-backed `Region::Array` (no serialization needed), so heap linked
lists and arrays-of-classes work too. `try_typed_malloc` keys off `T *p =
MAlloc(...)` / `p = MAlloc(...)` to pick the representation from the target type.

`token.rs` similarly generates the `Keyword` enum + `from_str`/`as_str`/`is_type`
from one `keywords!` table to avoid drift.

## HolyC / implementation semantics worth knowing

- Default integer is `I64`; there is no `F32` (only `F64`). A bare string
  statement prints itself; `"fmt", a, b` is printf-style. A bare function name
  is a call (`Main;` runs `Main()`).
- **Calls must resolve** to a defined function or a registered builtin — an
  unknown call is a compile-time error (no implicit-extern fallback).
- **`_`-directory privacy** (Go's `internal/`, generalized to *any* directory
  whose name begins with `_`, and applied to all code — stdlib and user programs
  alike): a function or `class`/`union` defined in a file under a `_`-prefixed
  directory may be referenced only from files in that directory's **parent**
  subtree; anyone else gets a compile-time error. It's a **sema-only** check (no
  effect on the interpreter or backends): the preprocessor stamps each token's
  `Span::file` with an index into a per-program file table (`Program::files`,
  `FileInfo` — each file's directory components + computed privacy root), the
  parser carries that file id onto AST-node spans via `Mark`, and sema's
  `check_private_access` gates `check_call` (functions) and `resolve_type`
  (types) by `FileInfo::visible_to`. The embedded stdlib is its own root
  namespace (`<stdlib>`), so e.g. `lib/_impl/strhash.hc`'s `Djb2` is private to
  the rest of the library (used by `lib/hmap.hc`'s `HmapStrHash`) but a compile error
  from user code. (Globals are not yet gated.) Tested in `tests/privacy.rs`.
- **`switch`** takes `switch (x)` or the bracketed `switch [x]` (parsed
  identically). A body may carry `start:` / `end:` sub-labels (the `Start`/`End`
  keywords, `StmtKind::SwitchStart`/`SwitchEnd`): `start:` is a **prologue** run
  on entry before dispatch, `end:` an **epilogue** reached by fall-through that a
  `break` skips. Sema (`validate_switch_labels`) enforces ≤1 of each, `start:`
  before every case and `end:` after; both backends partition the body the same
  way (interp `exec_stmts_range`, arm64 `gen_switch`). Because they're keywords,
  `start`/`end` cannot be identifiers. The arm64 backend lowers a dense switch to
  an O(1) **jump table** (`try_gen_branch_table`) — when every case folds to a
  compile-time integer constant (`const_eval_i64` handles int/char literals,
  unary ops, and constant `+ - * / % & | ^ <<`) and the value span is small/
  dense, it emits a `span`-entry table of 32-bit offset words
  (`table[k] = label_k - table`, via the `Fixup::TableRel` data fixup — a
  section-internal distance needing no Mach-O relocation). Dispatch is
  `idx = v - min`, an unsigned bounds check (`COND_HI`), then
  `LDRSW off, [table, idx, lsl #2]; BR (table + off)`. Gaps/out-of-range and
  overlapping ranges resolve exactly as the compare-chain fallback does; sparse
  or non-constant switches keep the linear compare-chain.
- **Chained range comparisons** are a pure parser desugar (`parse_binary`): a run
  of relational operators at the same precedence (`a < b < c`, `0 <= i < n`)
  becomes the conjunction `(a<b) && (b<c)` (`is_chain_cmp` selects `< <= > >=`;
  `==`/`!=` keep C's `(a==b)==c`). Interior operands are *cloned* into both
  comparisons (so `a < f() < b` calls twice). Sema and both backends are
  untouched — they only ever see the standard `&&`-of-comparisons AST.
- **String array initializers** are a pure parser desugar
  (`string_array_init`/`infer_array_len` in `finish_declarator`): `U8 s[] = "abc"`
  sizes the array to the byte count plus the NUL (`s[4]`), then both forms desugar
  the string to a byte brace list — `U8 s[N] = "abc"` becomes
  `{'a','b','c',0}` — so the ordinary brace-init path (interpreter + every backend)
  handles it with no new code. The NUL is appended then the list is capped to a
  constant `N`, so an exactly-filled array (`U8 s[3] = "abc"`) drops it, matching C;
  a string initialiser for a *pointer* (`U8 *p = "abc"`) is left as a pointer to
  the literal.
- **Scalar stores coerce to the lvalue type** in the interpreter (`coerce_to` in
  `eval_init`/`eval_assign`): `I64 w = 3.14;` truncates to `3` and `F64 x = 5;`
  widens to `5.0`, matching the native backend (which truncates/widens in
  registers). Without this the interpreter kept the source `Value` and diverged
  on later arithmetic. `coerce_to` also decays a **string literal stored into a
  pointer** to one stable byte buffer, so pointer identity over it (`p - s`,
  `p == s`, `p++`) is consistent — mirroring the native backend's single `__text`
  copy (each `as_pointer` of a `Value::Str` would otherwise mint a fresh buffer).
- **Locals are zero-initialized** when declared without an initializer, in both
  backends: scalars and *aggregates alike* read back as 0 until written (interp
  fills its value; native zeroes the slot — `gen_zero_slot` for an aggregate, a
  store of 0 for a scalar). Reading an untouched local is therefore defined, not
  stack garbage. (Globals are linker-zeroed.)
- **Narrow integers (`U8`/`I8`/`U16`/`I16`/`U32`/`I32`) follow C width rules** in
  both backends: arithmetic promotes to `I64` (no mid-expression wrap — `U8 a =
  200; a + 100` is `300`), then the value truncates to the declared width at each
  boundary: on store (interp `coerce_to`/`cast_value`; native store width or an
  explicit cast), on **argument passing** (interp coerces the arg to `p.ty` in
  `call`; native spills at the param width), and on **return** (interp coerces to
  `f.ret`; arm64 `gen_cast(&cur_ret)` — `SBFM`/`UBFM`; x86-64 `Asm::cast_rax` — an
  in-register `movsx`/`movzx`/`movsxd rax`, since there's no store to truncate). So
  `U8 f(){return 300;}` yields `44`, `I8 f(){return 200;}` `-56`. The arg-truncation
  case was an interp-only gap, and the x86-64 return-truncation an x86-64-only gap,
  before these.
- **`>>`, `/`, `%` are signedness-directed** in both backends (C semantics),
  keyed off the left operand's `ty()` (the lvalue's type for the `>>=`/`/=`/`%=`
  compound forms), threaded through `apply_binop` (interp) and `emit_int_binop`
  (native) as a `signed` flag (default signed — HolyC's default int is `I64`):
  `>>` is arithmetic for signed / logical for unsigned (`wrapping_shr` vs a `u64`
  shift; `ASRV` vs `LSRV`); `/` and `%` are signed/unsigned division
  (`wrapping_div`/`rem` vs `u64` ops; `SDIV` vs `UDIV`). So `-8 >> 1 == -4`,
  `0x8000…U64 >> 4` shifts in zeros, and `0x8000…U64 / 2 == 0x4000…`.
  `const_eval_i64` folds these the same way for the jump table. (`<<` is identical
  either way.)
- **Relational compares `< > <= >=` are signedness-directed**, but by the usual
  arithmetic conversions: **unsigned if either operand is unsigned** (vs the
  left-operand rule for shift/divide). The interpreter compares as `i64` or `u64`
  (`apply_binop`); the native backend picks signed (`LT/GT/LE/GE`) vs unsigned
  (`LO/HI/LS/HS`) condition codes (`gen_binary`). Both also compare integers at
  **full 64-bit width** — `==`/`!=` (`values_equal`) and the `<`-family no longer
  route through `f64`, which silently lost precision past 2^53 (e.g. `2^53+1 ==
  2^53` wrongly read true). F64 operands still compare as floats in both.
- **Float→integer conversion is signedness-directed**: an unsigned integer target
  uses `FCVTZU` / `f as u64` (saturating; negatives clamp to 0), a signed one
  `FCVTZS` / `f as i64` — they differ past `I64::MAX`, so `U64 u = 1e19` gives
  `10000000000000000000`, not the signed-saturated `I64::MAX`. The interpreter
  keys off the target type in `cast_value` (reached by every `coerce_to` site and
  by explicit casts); the native backend, where `gen_expr` has no target type,
  routes the int-store sites (var init, assignment, aggregate element, return,
  call argument) and explicit casts through `gen_int_expr(e, target)`.
- HolyC has no `struct` keyword: the aggregate is `class` (a plain `repr(C)` data
  type) plus `union`. The codebase follows this — the interpreter's aggregate
  value is `Value::Class` and helpers are named `class_*` (the Rust `struct`
  keyword still appears, but only for actual Rust structs, never a HolyC type).
  Classes/unions use `repr(C)` layout (natural alignment, declaration order, no
  reordering). Classes and array-by-reference behave by **C semantics**: a class
  is passed/assigned **by value** (deep copy), arrays **decay to pointers** (by
  reference).
- **Unions embed in classes.** A `union { … };` is anonymous — its members are
  *promoted* into the enclosing class (`obj.field`); a `union Name { … } m;` (or
  a `union Name m;` over a predefined union) is a named member (`obj.m.field`).
  The parser turns each embedded union into a synthetic top-level type (named or
  `$anonN`) injected via `Parser::pending_types`; the layout *promotes* an
  anonymous union's members into the parent at the union's offset
  (`is_anon_field`), so the native backend (offset-driven) and `sema::lookup_field`
  resolve them, and the interpreter's member access flattens through them. (Only
  unions embed this way — not anonymous classes.)

## The arm64 backend's self-consistent ABI

Because solomon functions only ever call each other (no class crosses the C
boundary; `_main` takes none), the native backend uses an internally consistent
ABI rather than full AAPCS64 register-packing:

- Integer/pointer args in `x0–x7`, **F64 args in `v0–v7`**, the two classes
  numbered independently. F64 values live in the FP register file (`v16`/`v17`
  as the expression evaluator's result/temp), spilled around calls via a GPR.
- **Classes by value**: an aggregate rvalue is represented by its *address*; a
  class arg is passed as a pointer in a GP register and the callee copies it
  into a local slot (`gen_memcpy`). Class **returns** use an sret pointer in
  `x8` (the callee writes the result through it). Whole-class assignment and
  copy-init are memcpies.
- **Array parameters** decay to pointers: the slot holds a pointer to the
  caller's data and the `VarLoc` is marked `indirect` (so `gen_addr_ident` loads
  the pointer); the declared array type is kept for index-stride math.
- Strings live inside `__text` and are addressed with self-resolved `ADR` (no
  relocation); globals are Mach-O **common symbols** (the linker allocates them).
  The relocations emitted are `bl`/`blr`-via-`bl` to libc externs (BRANCH26) and
  global `ADRP`/`ADD` (PAGE21/PAGEOFF12).
- **Function pointers**: `&Func` is a self-resolved `ADR` to the function's
  `__text` label (no relocation, like strings). An indirect call (`fp(args)`)
  spills the callee address, evaluates args through the normal ABI, then `BLR`s
  it; the callee's `Type::FuncPtr` signature drives arg classing and the return.

Print formatting is shared: `src/fmt.rs` parses each `%[flags][width][.prec]
[length]conv` spec once, and both backends consume it — the native side rebuilds
a libc format string (`to_c_format`, injecting the `ll` length so 64-bit args
print in full), the interpreter renders the value itself (`render_int`/
`render_str`) applying the same flags/width/precision. So `%-08.3x`, `%+5d`,
`%o`, `%*d`, full-width `%u`/`%x`, `%f` (six decimals by default, like libc), and
the scientific/general float forms `%e`/`%E`/`%g`/`%G` (`render_exp`/`render_g` —
Rust's `{:e}` does the correctly-rounded mantissa, then the exponent is restyled
to libc's `e±dd`) all agree. There is no longer any known formatting divergence
between the backends; all the `examples/*.hc` programs compile and run natively
with byte-identical output.

## Status note

Code generation is implemented for all three native targets (the default,
host-target build, or `--target TRIPLE` for a specific triple). The backends
compile the whole implemented
HolyC subset, including the `offset` keyword, brace aggregate initializers
(`I64 a[] = {1,2,3}`, `Pt p = {1,2}`, nested and partial), designated class
initializers (`Pt p = {.x = 1, .y = 2}`, out-of-order, partial, and nested), and
member access on a call result (`Mk().x`, including nested paths and F64 fields).
Brace/designated initializers are implemented identically across **all** backends
(arm64 Darwin + freestanding, x86-64) via a shared recursive `gen_init_into` per
backend — positional, designated/out-of-order, nested, partial, and arrays of
classes, for both locals (slot zeroed first) and globals (BSS-zeroed).
`#include "file"` is resolved (read + spliced, relative to the including file,
with cycle/depth guards), and the irreducible core-library primitives are
builtins (`MAlloc`, `Free`, the printf family, the clock/vararg/argv groups, …; the
reducible ops — including `Sqrt` (a Newton + Dekker-residual sqrt) and `Fabs` (a
`union` sign-bit clear) — moved to `lib/*.hc`, see the `builtins.rs` note above).
Function pointers
work end to end: the `ret (*name)
(types)` declarator (in var decls and as callback parameters), `&Func` to take a
function's address, and calls through a pointer (`fp(args)`) — both native backends
lower indirect calls off the callee's `Type::FuncPtr` (arm64 `ADR`+`BLR`; x86-64
`lea`s the function address for `&Func` and `call`s through a register, spilling
the target across argument evaluation). This extends to the
dispatch-table / vtable patterns: function-pointer **class fields**
(`s.method(args)`), **arrays** of function pointers (`I64 (*ops[])(...) = {&A,
&B}`, indexed and called), and brace-initialising them with `&Func`.
`typedef <type> <name>;` registers a type alias — including function-pointer
aliases (`typedef I64 (*BinOp)(I64,I64);`) which also make the "function
returning a function pointer" form usable (`BinOp Pick(){...}`). Aliases are
resolved at parse time (`Parser::type_aliases`, in `parse_base_type`), so they
never reach the AST as `Named` types and must be defined before use; they are
not hoisted (the C rule). The bracketed `switch [x]` form and `start:` / `end:`
sub-labels (prologue/epilogue) are lowered in both backends.

**Generic classes (monomorphization).** `class Vec<T> { T *data; … }` declares a
generic `class`/`union` template; each use in **type position** (`Vec<I64>`,
`Pair<I64, F64>`, nested `Vec<Vec<I64>>`) is monomorphized at **parse time** into a
concrete synthetic class with the parameters substituted — `Vec_I64`, `Pair_I64_F64`
(mangled via `mangle_generic`/`mangle_type`, pointer args as `PU8` etc.). The parser
records templates in `Parser::generic_classes` (define-before-use, like `typedef`),
`parse_base_type` detects `Name<args>` and calls `instantiate_generic` (substitute via
`subst_type`, dedup by mangled name in `generic_done`, inject the concrete `ClassDef`
through the existing `pending_types` path). So sema/layout/all backends only ever see
ordinary concrete classes — **no downstream changes**. Arg type-args parse recursively,
giving nesting/fixpoint for free; nested `Vec<Vec<I64>>` works because `expect_generic_gt`
splits the `>>` (`Shr`) token.

**Generic functions (monomorphization).** `T VecPush<T>(Vec<T> *v, T x) { … }` declares a
generic function; a call `VecPush<I64>(&v, x)` monomorphizes it to a concrete
`VecPush_I64`. Because a function body can mention `T`/`Vec<T>` in many positions
(params, casts, `sizeof`, locals, return), the template is captured as **raw tokens**
(never AST-parsed in generic form): `looks_like_generic_fn` detects `Ret Name<…>(` at
statement level (so it's recognised even when the return type is a bare type param like
`T`), `capture_generic_fn` grabs the tokens through the body `}` and records the name +
type-param list. A call site (`parse_postfix`) rewrites `Name<args>(…)` to a call to the
mangled `Name_I64` and queues `(name, type-args)`. After the main parse, `parse_program`
drains the queue: `instantiate_generic_fn` substitutes the type-param **tokens** with the
argument's tokens (`type_to_tokens`), drops the `<T>` list, renames to the mangled name,
and **re-parses** the result through the same parser (so `Vec<I64>` in the body
instantiates the class and nested generic calls re-queue) — to a fixpoint, deduped by
`generic_fn_done`. The generated concrete functions/classes are appended as top-level
items, so again **nothing downstream changes**.

Calls may give the type args **explicitly** (`VecPush<I64>(…)`) or have them
**inferred** (`VecPush(&v, x)`). Inference is parse-time: the parser records declared
variable/parameter types (`var_types`, recording-only so non-generic code is unaffected)
and, for each generic function, the per-parameter [`TypePattern`]s
(`param_type_patterns` — `T` → `Param`, `Vec<T>*` → `Ptr(Generic("Vec",[Param]))`). At an
un-annotated call it computes each argument's static type (`arg_type`: a literal, a
variable, `&variable`, an explicit **cast** — its own type — or a **call result** — the
callee's return type from the recording-only `fn_rets` map) and unifies it against the
patterns (`unify_pattern`), using the `generic_instances` reverse map (`Vec_I64` →
`("Vec",[I64])`) so a `Vec<T>*` parameter matched against a `Vec_I64*` argument binds
`T=I64`. If a parameter can't be inferred it's a clear error suggesting the explicit
form. `arg_type` is **syntactic and parse-time** (inference runs before sema), so the
forms it can't type — member access, indexing, arithmetic, deref, and a call to a
function defined *after* the call site (`fn_rets` is "seen so far") — fall back to the
explicit `<...>`. A type parameter only needs *some* inferable argument: it's typically
recovered from a `Vec<T>*`/`Hmap<K,V>*` receiver, so a complex other argument is fine.
See `examples/generic.hc`.
Still genuinely absent: most of the TempleOS core/standard library and DolDoc.

The worked HolyC programs live in `examples/*.hc` (top-level), listed once in
`tests/common/mod.rs` (`common::EXAMPLES`) and exercised by `tests/examples.rs`
(tokenize/parse/sema/run-clean over the whole list), `tests/programs.rs` (exact
interpreter output for the substantive ones), and `tests/arm64_darwin.rs`, whose
`native_matches_interp_for_every_example` compiles **every** example with the
native backend and asserts byte-for-byte equality with the interpreter — the
catch-all that keeps new examples and backend changes honest.
