//! Compiler-recognized standard-library functions ("intrinsics").
//!
//! An intrinsic is an ordinary function **defined in `lib/*.hc`** — sema resolves
//! calls to it and the interpreter runs its HolyC body — for which a native backend
//! may emit a **special lowering** for the recognized name instead of a plain call:
//! a single instruction, a syscall, or bespoke runtime. This is the seam that lets
//! the builtin *registry* ([`crate::builtins`]) shrink to the handful of primitives
//! that can't be library functions at all (`ArgC`/`ArgV`/`VarArg*`) — everything
//! algebraic or OS-level lives in the library and is recognized here.
//!
//! The flavour is [`IntrinsicKind`]. An **optimization** has a real HolyC body the
//! backend may replace with a faster equivalent where the target supports it (e.g.
//! `Sqrt` → `fsqrt`/`sqrtsd`, falling back to the lib implementation otherwise);
//! conformance holds because both compute the same value (the lib `Sqrt` is
//! correctly rounded, bit-identical to the instruction). The interpreter never needs
//! to special-case an optimization intrinsic — it just runs the HolyC body.

/// How the backends may treat a recognized intrinsic call.
